* How To Contribute

Before starting to work on any big feature, that is not mentioned on
the [[file:TODO.org][TODOs]], I recommend you to send me an email first.

** How to submit a PR?
+ Feel free to send me a patch, here's how to create one

#+begin_src bash
$ git clone https://git.thanosapollo.com/<repo>.git && cd <repo>
$ emacs something
$ git add something
$ git commit -m "Fix something"
$ git format-patch HEAD^1
0001-Fix-something.patch
#+end_src

/You can find my email on the git log/
